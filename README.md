## Rest Assured Book API  Framework

This project is a robust API automation framework designed to verify the key functionalities of a FastAPI-powered BookStore application. It offers end-to-end test coverage for:

üîÅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

‚ö†Ô∏è Error and edge case handling

üîê Authentication and security validations

With comprehensive reporting and smooth CI/CD integration, this framework ensures consistent, high-quality feedback throughout the development lifecycle.

###  Technologies & Framework Stack

Java (17): Primary language used to implement framework logic

RestAssured: For automating and validating RESTful API endpoints

TestNG: Manages test execution flow and configurations

ExtentReports: Produces rich, interactive HTML reports for test results

Maven: Handles project builds, dependencies, and lifecycle phases

GitHub Actions: Enables CI/CD for automated testing and deployments 

---

###  Scope of Test Coverage

The framework covers the following test scenarios for Health check, User, and Book APIs:

 ###  Expected Functional Outcomes
- Verify if the server is up and running

- Register a new user and log in with valid credentials

- Add a new book using valid input data

- Fetch the complete list of books

- Retrieve details of a specific book by its ID

- Modify the details of an existing book

- Remove a book from the system

### Negative Validations
- Access APIs with invalid or missing tokens
- Attempt to get non-existent books
- Sign-up/login with invalid credentials


## Request Chaining

The access token obtained from the login API is dynamically applied to subsequent requests‚Äîsuch as create, update, and delete book operations‚Äîfacilitating smooth request chaining.

##  Test Strategy

 1. API Test Case Architecture
- Designed modular test classes for each core resource: User, Book, and Health

- Leveraged dependsOnGroups to handle inter-class dependencies (e.g., Book tests require a successful login)

- Implemented request chaining to support token-based authentication flows

- Utilized a centralized data.json file for input data, promoting cleaner and more maintainable test code



###  2.Scalability
- Configurable base URL and tokens using `config.properties`
- Clear separation of concerns: logic, request specs, data, reporting
- Assertions for status codes, response structure, and error messages
- Positive and negative test cases for all endpoints
- Common utility methods for validation
- Used `BaseTest` and `Listeners` to manage test lifecycle and reports

 ##  3. Challenges & Resolutions

| **Challenge**                                          | **Resolution**                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API returned `500` instead of `422` for invalid inputs | Implemented payload validation and added assertions to identify backend misbehavior |
| API returned `400` for undocumented cases              | Recommended enhancing Swagger documentation for accuracy                            |
| Missing Delete API for User resource                   | Proposed adding a Delete endpoint or implementing user reuse strategies in tests    |
| Interdependent test classes causing execution issues   | Adopted `dependsOnGroups` to manage test flow more effectively                      |
| No backend validation for empty email or book name     | Highlighted the issue and suggested server-side input validation                    |
